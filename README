Twicli <http://www.geocities.jp/twicli/twicli.html> is a browser based twitter
client that was originally developed by NeoCat <http://twitter.com/NeoCat>.

I, edvakf <http://my.opera.com/edvakf/blog/>, ported it to Opera Unite.
The main part of twicli is almost not modified at all.
What I did was to make a twicli plugin, operaunite.js, and the server side
caching mechanizm.

This is not a fork of the original Twicli, so when the original is updated,
all you need to do to be up-to-date is to download the files, then remove all
the "geocities" related part of the source.
